        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, relevant documents or pieces of information are retrieved from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that identifies the most relevant documents based on the input query.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from these documents is incorporated into the input to provide additional context or knowledge that can be used by the generative model.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The additional context from the retrieved documents helps the model produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can provide more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\""

            "Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to deliver useful, accurate, and relevant responses. It is primarily used with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. The goal is to optimize the output from these models by crafting well-engineered prompts, which can lead to improved results and efficiency. Prompt engineering involves creating prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses, and it is used in various applications such as customer support, content generation, and data analysis. It is an iterative process that involves experimenting and refining prompts to achieve the best results.\n",
            "\n",
            "**History:**\n",
            "The history of prompt engineering is closely tied to the development of large language models (LLMs). Initially, prompts were simple, but as LLMs like GPT-3 became more complex, prompt engineering evolved to match this complexity. Key developments in the field include the introduction of attention mechanisms in 2015, which revolutionized prompt engineering by enhancing language models' contextual understanding. The rise of massive language models like GPT-3 in 2020-2021 transformed prompt engineering, allowing for greater adaptability and domain-specific tailoring. Advanced prompting techniques in 2022-2023, such as multimodal prompting, have further enhanced the versatility and interactive capabilities of language models. Prompt engineering has continually evolved to address issues like exposure bias and biases in generated text, making language models more powerful and context-aware.\n",

This approach allows models to respond to user queries by referencing a specified set of documents, thereby augmenting the information drawn from their own static training data. RAG is particularly useful for providing more accurate and up-to-date responses compared to purely generative models.\n",
            "\n",
            "The concept of RAG has been gaining traction in recent years, with significant advancements and applications emerging around 2024. For instance, a paper titled \"Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks\" published in July 2024, discusses the evolution of RAG systems and introduces a modular framework to enhance their capabilities. This framework allows for a more reconfigurable design, integrating advanced retrievers and language models to tackle knowledge-intensive tasks.\n",
